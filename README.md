## What this is

AIEN is a native Rust workspace for running agents and local inference on your own hardware: an agent CLI and runtime, persistent memory, a unified-memory KV-cache with copy-on-write branching, a continuous-batching scheduler, and an inference ABI with Modular MAX and Mojo bridges. The primary reference machine is an NVIDIA DGX Spark (Grace Blackwell GB10). Execution today is hybrid CPU and GPU.

Built by [Drake Stapleton](https://www.drakestapleton.com) with AI collaborators. Contributions and hard questions are welcome.

## How we publish numbers

Every headline performance figure must resolve to a reproducible command and an artifact bundle: commit identity, hardware and environment record, exact command, raw samples, SHA-256 digests, measurement definition, and reproducibility steps. Figures published before 23 September 2026 are withdrawn until they are regenerated to that standard. Current status: [Measured Results](https://github.com/aien-dev/aien-sovereign-core#measured-results).
